#1 We did Nonlinear regression for spectral density functions using a multi-layer neural 
network with the help of tensorflow.

#2 It is well-known that most machine learning methods are in nature interpolation. 
We have tested the fitting capacity for neural network: 
	
  2.1 For interpolation, a simple NN can fit very complicated combination of simple 
  mathematical functions efficiently.
	
  2.2 For extrapolation, NN usually gives poor results. 

#3 In "fitting spectral density obtained from MD.png", I use 2 Debye functions and 12 
Lorentzian functions to fit a really complicated spectral density form obtained from 
molecular dynamics simulation. This picture has nothing to do with neural network. 
Just want to demonstrate  the experimental J(w) can be well-approximated using 
a series of Lorentizan distributions. However, readers who feel this interesting can use this kind of 
"unfriend" distribution to further test the ability of deep neural network.
