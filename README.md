#1 We did Nonlinear regression for spectral density functions using a multi-layer neural 
network with the help of tensorflow.

#2 We have tested the fitting capacity for neural network: 
	2.1 For interpolation, a simple NN can fit very complicated combination of simple 
	    mathematical functions efficiently.
	2.2 For extrapolation, NN usually gives poor results. 

	It is well-known that most machine learning methods are in nature interpolation.
